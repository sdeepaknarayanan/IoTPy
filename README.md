# IoTPy: Python + Streams

</div>

## Description

IoTPy is a Python package that helps you to build applications that operate on streams of data.

THE TWO GOALS OF IOTPY

Build non-terminating functions that operate on endless streams by reusing terminating functions, such as those in libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

Build multithreaded, multicore, distributed applications by simply connecting streams.

Sensors, social media, news feeds, webcams and other sources generate streams of data. Many applications ingest and analyze data streams to control actuators, generate alerts, and feed continuous displays. IoTPy helps you to build such applications.

IoTPy is currently distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
